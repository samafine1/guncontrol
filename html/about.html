				 	This website was created by students at Lick Wilmerding High School in San Francisco, California. We have grown up with mass shootings, and we have watched them become normalized as they keep happening and no one does anything. We also realized, that although we knew that gun control could help prevent mass shootings, we did not know the specific federal or local legislation that affects gun usage in the United States. We decided to make this website as a place to learn about gun legislation and how to change it. We hope that this website make everyone more informed about the laws that are in place currently, the laws that are being proposed, and how to affect change.
