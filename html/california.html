  					<h2> PROPOSED LEGISLATION </h2>
  					<hr>
					<h3>Expanding the definition of assault weapons.</h3> <p>High-powered semi-automatic rifles without fixed magazines would now be identified by law as assault weapons. .22 rifles would still be excluded.</p>
					<h4>What effect would this have? </h4> <p> Approximately 2 million more guns would be required to be registered in the state of California. California requires that all weapons classified as assault weapons must be registered. </p>
 					<hr>
					<h3>Adapting restrictions on who can ask for a gun violence restraining order.</h3><p> Police and family are allowed under California law to ask a judge to take away an individual’s firearms if they think there is evidence they may be a threat. This law proposes to expand who is able to ask for one of these restraining orders.</p>

					<h4>What effect would this have?</h4> <p>Faculty at high schools and colleges, therapists and mental health workers, and co-workers would all be allowed to go to a judge and request a gun restraining order.</p>
					<h5>Proposed by Assemblyman Phil Ting of San Francisco</h5>
 					<hr>
					<h3>Judges can issue gun restraining orders orally.</h3><p> This bill would allow judges to enact a restraining order orally, but only with police testimony.</p>
					<h4>What effect would this have? </h4> <p> It would be easier and quicker to impose restrictions quickly on individuals deemed dangerous by the police. </p>
					<h5>Proposed by Assemblywoman Blanca Rubio of Baldwin Park</h5>
 					<hr>
					<h3>Individuals convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence banned from carrying firearms.</h3><p> Individuals who have acted violently or threatened violence against family members would fall under a lifelong ban to carry firearms.</p>
					<h4>What effects would this have?</h4><p> Would ban those known to act out in violence from owning and carrying firearms.</p>
					<h5>Proposed by Assemblywoman Blanca Rubio of Baldwin Park</h5>
