				 	<h2> CURRENT LEGISLATION </h2>
				 	<p>
				 	This text is designed to accompany your study of introductory digital signal processing.<sup>1</sup> It’s an eccentric piece of not-so-rigorous literature with a preoccupation for explaining things using interactive visualizations, animations and sound.<sup>2</sup> My goal is to explain the Discrete Fourier Transform using a miniature curriculum which leverages your ability to learn concepts and absorb information <i>visually</i> instead of linguistically.<sup>3</sup> My hope is that these glyphs become slightly more comprehensible and slightly less intimidating after reading the subsequent 30 or so pages.<sup>4</sup>

  						“One reason math texts are so abstruse and technical is because of all the specifications and conditions that have to be put on theorems to keep them out of crevasses. In this sense, they’re like legal documents, and often about as much fun to read.”<br/><br/>

  					<h2> PROPOSED LEGISLATION </h2>
  					<hr>
					<h3>Expanding the definition of assault weapons.</h3> <p>High-powered semi-automatic rifles without fixed magazines would now be identified by law as assault weapons. .22 rifles would still be excluded.</p>
					<h4>What effect would this have? </h4> <p> Approximately 2 million more guns would be required to be registered in the state of California. California requires that all weapons classified as assault weapons must be registered. </p>
 					<hr>
					<h3>Adapting restrictions on who can ask for a gun violence restraining order.</h3><p> Police and family are allowed under California law to ask a judge to take away an individual’s firearms if they think there is evidence they may be a threat. This law proposes to expand who is able to ask for one of these restraining orders.</p>

					<h4>What effect would this have?</h4> <p>Faculty at high schools and colleges, therapists and mental health workers, and co-workers would all be allowed to go to a judge and request a gun restraining order.</p>
					<h5>Proposed by Assemblyman Phil Ting of San Francisco</h5>
 					<hr>
					<h3>Judges can issue gun restraining orders orally.</h3><p> This bill would allow judges to enact a restraining order orally, but only with police testimony.</p>
					<h4>What effect would this have? </h4> <p> It would be easier and quicker to impose restrictions quickly on individuals deemed dangerous by the police. </p>
					<h5>Proposed by Assemblywoman Blanca Rubio of Baldwin Park</h5>
 					<hr>
					<h3>Individuals convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence banned from carrying firearms.</h3><p> Individuals who have acted violently or threatened violence against family members would fall under a lifelong ban to carry firearms.</p>
					<h4>What effects would this have?</h4><p> Would ban those known to act out in violence from owning and carrying firearms.</p>
					<h5>Proposed by Assemblywoman Blanca Rubio of Baldwin Park</h5>

					If you want a solid introduction to digital signal processing, I strongly suggest that you read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Digital-Signal-Processing-Edition/dp/0137027419"> Understanding Digital Signal Processing </a> by Richard J Lyons. Lyons writes with a great deal of empathy for the reader, patiently explicating concepts that other authors might deem to be “obvious”. Paolo Prandoni and Martin Vetterli periodically offer <a href="https://youtu.be/Fa-r34Ciwog">a course</a> on digital signal processing through <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/dsp">Coursera</a>. Their course is free, and the lectures are really quite lovely. Martin and Paolo have also written <a href="http://www.sp4comm.org/">Signal Processing for Communications</a>, which is freely available online.<sup>6</sup> <a href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/">Julius O. Smith III</a> has an encyclopedic catalog of DSP writings freely available on his <a href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/"> site</a>. Smith’s online text, <a href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/mdft/">The Mathematics of the Discrete Fourier Transform </a> is of particular interest. <a href="http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~dpwe/">Dan Ellis</a> posts all of his teaching materials online for free and open access. Geoff Martin’s delightful <a href="http://www.tonmeister.ca/main/textbook/index.html">online book</a> is recommended if you’re interested in a less formal, but still very thorough resource on mathematics and DSP.
