  					<h2> PROPOSED LEGISLATION </h2>
  					<hr>
  					<h3> <a href= "https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB2888&search_keywords=firearms" > AB-2888 Gun violence restraining orders </a></h3>
					<h4>Adapting restrictions on who can ask for a gun violence restraining order.</h4> 
					<p>Police and family are allowed under California law to ask a judge to take away an individual’s firearms if they think there is evidence they may be a threat. This law proposes to expand who is able to ask for one of these restraining orders.</p>
					<h4>What effect would this have? </h4> <p> Faculty at high schools and colleges, therapists and mental health workers, and co-workers would all be allowed to go to a judge and request a gun restraining order. </p>
					<h5>Proposed by Assemblyman Phil Ting of San Francisco</h5>

 					<hr>

 					<h3> <a href= "https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB2526&search_keywords=firearms" > AB-2526 Temporary emergency gun violence restraining orders</a></h3>
					<h4>Judges can issue gun restraining orders orally.</h4>
					<p> This bill would allow judges to enact a restraining order orally, but only with police testimony.</p>
					<h4>What effect would this have?</h4> <p>It would be easier and quicker to impose restrictions quickly on individuals deemed dangerous by the police.</p>
					<h5>Proposed by Assemblywoman Blanca Rubio of Baldwin Park</h5>

 					<hr>

 					<h3> <a href= "https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB3129&search_keywords=firearms" > AB-3129 Firearms: prohibited persons</a></h3>
					<h4>Individuals convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence banned from carrying firearms.</h4>
					<p> Individuals who have acted violently or threatened violence against family members would fall under a lifelong ban to carry firearms.</p>
					<h4>What effect would this have? </h4> <p> Would ban those known to act out in violence from owning and carrying firearms.</p>
					<h5>Proposed by Assemblywoman Blanca Rubio of Baldwin Park</h5>

 					<hr>

 					<h3> <a href= "https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB2222" > AB-2222 Crime prevention and investigation: informational databases</a></h3>
					<h4>Police/Law enforcement must log information about lost, stolen, and recovered firearms into a state database within 7 days of the reported event.</h4>
					<p> The firearm is required to stay in the system until it is returned to the legal owner.</p>
					<h4>What effects would this have?</h4><p> It would increase documentation of firearms in California overall and work toward ensuring that lost and stolen weapons are in a government system in case they are used in a crime or found. </p>
					<h5>Proposed by Assemblyman Bill Quirk of Oakland</h5>

					<hr>

					<h3> <a href= "https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB1927&search_keywords=do+not+sell" > AB-1927 Firearms: California Do Not Sell List</a></h3>
					<h4>Anyone could add themselves to the California “Do Not Sell list.”</h4>
					<p> At the moment only certain classes of people, mostly those who have been found guilty of crimes, are required to be added to the Do Not Sell list. This bill would allow anyone to report themselves if they believe they will be a danger to others. After 365 days of the report a person could submit an appeal to have the ban revoked. </p>
					<h4>What effects would this have?</h4><p> Individuals who deem themselves mentally unfit or dangerous could report themselves to prevent themselves to get a firearm. Government sponsored suicide hotlines would be authorized to inform callers of the Do Not Sell list in order to prevent suicides using firearms.</p>
					<h5>Proposed by Assemblyman Rob Bonta of Oakland</h5>

					<hr>

					<h3> <a href= "https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB2382&search_keywords=firearm"> AB-2382 Firearms: firearm precursor parts</a></h3>
					<h4>Background checks for buyers of parts needed to make/assemble assault weapons.</h4>
					<p>  Right now background checks are only required for buyers of fully assembled firearms. </p>
					<h4>What effects would this have?</h4><p> Would stop anyone who would not pass a background check from being able to get their hands on assault weapons by buying seperate pieces.</p>
					<h5>Propsed by Assemblyman Mike Gipson of Carson</h5>
					
					<hr>

					<h3> <a href= "https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB1903&search_keywords=buy+back">AB-1903 Firearms: buyback programs: gift cards</a></h3>
					<h4>Would prevent cities, counties, and states from giving out gift cards for establishments that sell firearms in return for gun buy-back.</h4>
					<h4>What effects would this have?</h4><p> People wouldn’t be able to sell back their guns just to get another, defeating the purpose of the program altogether.</p>
					<h5>Propsed by Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez Fletcher of San Diego</h5>
					
					<hr>

					<h3> <a href= "https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB1968&search_keywords=firearm"> AB-1968 Mental health: firearms</a></h3>
					<h4>Would prohibit individuals who were admitted to a mental health facility for being a danger to themselves or others from owning a firearm for the rest of their life.</h4>
					<p> Right now the law only prohibits them from owning a gun for 5 years after their release, a period of time that can be appealed. Individuals would have to appeal every 5 years during the lifetime ban to show they could safely use firearms.</p>
					<h4>What effects would this have?</h4><p>People proven to struggle with mental health would be subject to more caution surrounding their ability to own and safely use firearms. It would hopefully prevent people who had struggled with mental health in the past from relapsing and being able to easily access guns.</p>
					<h5>Propsed by Assemblyman Evan Low of Silicon Valley</h5>

					<h3> <a href= "https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB2781&search_keywords=firearm"> AB-2781 Forensic ballistic and firearms procedures</a></h3>
					<h4>Would require the bullet casings and and cartridge cases at crime scenes to be collected and submitted to the National Integrated Ballistic Identification Network.</h4>
					<p> Would also required that recovered firearms be test fired and ballistic imaging be submitted to national database.</p>
					<h4>What effects would this have?</h4><p> More information about firearms and bullets could allow law enforcement to connect weapons to any other crimes by having all data in a central system.</p>

				Suzanne Levy is a writer and radio and TV producer who has written and worked for NPR, the New York Times, and BBC. In this article for KPCC, a Southern California based news organization and radio station, she created an infographic chart which compares California and federal firearms laws in many categories, from the age requirement to the requirements on permits to carry. The graphic breaks down the vast differences in law in 11 different categories. The website we are creating is specifically for students and people from California, so this source is particularly helpful in getting information about the differences between federal and California law that we can include in the website.

					This recent article by Associated Press journalist Don Thompson outlines 10 new gun control bills that have been proposed by Californian assembly people. These 10 new bills would increase restrictions on firearms in California and expand the the definitions of what is classified as an assault weapon and who can report possible dangerous individuals for firearm restraining orders. The bills are an extension of several other passed at the beginning of 2018, and were influenced by the shooting at Stoneman Douglass. The article will be used on the website to inform readers about the possibility of increased gun legislation in California and will be paired with more information about legislation that is already in place. Readers of the website will be informed about possible laws and can use that information to mobilize behind some of these bills.
