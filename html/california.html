				 <br/>
  					<h2> PROPOSED LEGISLATION </h2>
  					<hr>
					<h3>Expanding the definition of assault weapons.</h3> <p>High-powered semi-automatic rifles without fixed magazines would now be identified by law as assault weapons. .22 rifles would still be excluded.</p>
					<h4>What effect would this have? </h4> <p> Approximately 2 million more guns would be required to be registered in the state of California. California requires that all weapons classified as assault weapons must be registered. </p>
 					<hr>
					<h3>Adapting restrictions on who can ask for a gun violence restraining order.</h3><p> Police and family are allowed under California law to ask a judge to take away an individual’s firearms if they think there is evidence they may be a threat. This law proposes to expand who is able to ask for one of these restraining orders.</p>

					<h4>What effect would this have?</h4> <p>Faculty at high schools and colleges, therapists and mental health workers, and co-workers would all be allowed to go to a judge and request a gun restraining order.</p>
					<h5>Proposed by Assemblyman Phil Ting of San Francisco</h5>
 					<hr>
					<h3>Judges can issue gun restraining orders orally.</h3><p> This bill would allow judges to enact a restraining order orally, but only with police testimony.</p>
					<h4>What effect would this have? </h4> <p> It would be easier and quicker to impose restrictions quickly on individuals deemed dangerous by the police. </p>
					<h5>Proposed by Assemblywoman Blanca Rubio of Baldwin Park</h5>
 					<hr>
					<h3>Individuals convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence banned from carrying firearms.</h3><p> Individuals who have acted violently or threatened violence against family members would fall under a lifelong ban to carry firearms.</p>
					<h4>What effects would this have?</h4><p> Would ban those known to act out in violence from owning and carrying firearms.</p>
					<h5>Proposed by Assemblywoman Blanca Rubio of Baldwin Park</h5>

				Suzanne Levy is a writer and radio and TV producer who has written and worked for NPR, the New York Times, and BBC. In this article for KPCC, a Southern California based news organization and radio station, she created an infographic chart which compares California and federal firearms laws in many categories, from the age requirement to the requirements on permits to carry. The graphic breaks down the vast differences in law in 11 different categories. The website we are creating is specifically for students and people from California, so this source is particularly helpful in getting information about the differences between federal and California law that we can include in the website.

					This recent article by Associated Press journalist Don Thompson outlines 10 new gun control bills that have been proposed by Californian assembly people. These 10 new bills would increase restrictions on firearms in California and expand the the definitions of what is classified as an assault weapon and who can report possible dangerous individuals for firearm restraining orders. The bills are an extension of several other passed at the beginning of 2018, and were influenced by the shooting at Stoneman Douglass. The article will be used on the website to inform readers about the possibility of increased gun legislation in California and will be paired with more information about legislation that is already in place. Readers of the website will be informed about possible laws and can use that information to mobilize behind some of these bills.
