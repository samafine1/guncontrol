				 	<p> Starting with the 2nd Amendment of the Constitution, here are all of the federal laws that currently affect gun usage in the United States:
				 	<h3> Second Amendment (1789) </h3>
				 	<p>A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. </p>
				 	<h3> National Firearms Act (1934) </h3>
				 	<h3> Gun Control Act (1968) </h3>
				 	<p> The Gun Control Act of 1968 was passed "to provide support to Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials in their fight against crime and violence."

				 	<h3> <a href = "https://www.congress.gov/103/bills/hr1025/BILLS-103hr1025enr.pdf">Brady Handgun Violence prevention Act (1993) </a></h3>

					<p>
					The Brady Law imposed a five-day waiting period for the purchase of a handgun in order for local law-enforcement officials to be able to perform background checks. This was struck down by the Supreme Court in Printz v. United States in 1997. However, from 1998 to today, federally liscensed dealers are required to use a National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) to conduct background checks on anyone intending to purchase a firearm. 
					</p>
					<h4> National Instant Criminal Background Check System </h4>
					<p> The NICS was launched by the FBI in 1998 and is used by Federal Firearms Lincensees (FFLs) to instantly determine whether a prospective buyer is elligible to buy a firearm. Before allowing the sale, dealers must call in a check to the FBI to make sure that the customer is not inelligible to buy a firearm. The NCIS only provides service to 30 states. If the NCIS is unavailable, states must perform their own background checks.

					 <div class="text" style="margin-left: 50px; line-height: 1.5">
			This journal article by Franklin E. Zimring at Berkeley Law explains the intricacies of the Gun Control Act of 1968 which was a pivotal law in the nation’s history of gun legislation. The article explores why the law was passed and what effects it has had since its passing. In order to provide as much information on gun legislation as possible on my website, it is imperative to include current federal gun laws, the Gun Control Act of 1968 being one of them. This article is helpful in understanding what the Gun Control Act of 1968 was, why it was passed, and how it is affecting our gun legislation today. It also elaborates on “legal impact” and what legislation must do in order to be impactful which is helpful for understanding what laws need to be passed in the future.
