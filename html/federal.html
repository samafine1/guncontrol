				 	<p> Starting with the 2nd Amendment of the Constitution, here are all of the federal laws that currently affect gun usage in the United States. Click the links in the titles to read the actual bills themselves:</p>
				 	<h3> Second Amendment (1789) </h3>
				 	<p>A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. </p>
				 	<h3> <a href = "https://archive.org/stream/NationalFirearmsActOf1934/National_Firearms_Act_of_1934_djvu.txt"> National Firearms Act (1934) </a></h3>
				 	<p> The National Firearms Act was passed to control the types of weapons used in organized crime and gangs: automatic weapons like machine guns and easily concealed short-barrel firearms such as sawed-off shotguns, along with mufflers and silencers (called "NFA firearms or devices"). The act did not ban them, instead it forced importers, manufacturers, and dealers to register them and pay an annual tax. It also required that intended purchasers complete an application including fingerprints and a photograph, and that importers, manufacturers, and dealers keep records of all transactions. </p>
				 	<h3><a href = "https://archive.org/stream/GunControlActOf1968PubLaw9061882StatPg1213/Gun_Control_Act_of_1968_Pub_Law_90-618_82_Stat_Pg_1213_djvu.txt"> Gun Control Act (1968)</a> </h3>
				 	<p> The Gun Control Act of 1968 was passed "to provide support to Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials in their fight against crime and violence." In order to accomplish that, it: </p>
				 	<p> <ul> 
				 		<li>Mandated liscensing for all importers, dealers, and manufacturers of firearms and ammunition involved in interstate or foreign arms with a Federal Firearms License (FFL)</li>
				 		<li> Prohibited using false information to acquire a firearm. </li>
				 		<li> Set the age for purchasing a handgun at 21.</li>
				 		<li> Prohibited the selling of firearms to convicted criminals, fugitives, drug addicts or mentally incompetent individuals. </li>
				 		<li> Required registration of all firearms with the national Firearms Registration and Transfer Record. </li>
				 		<li> Prohibited the possession of firearms which have altered or removed serial numbers </li>
				 		<li> Eliminated mail order delivery of firearms to unlicensed individuals. </li>
				 	</ul></p>

				 	<h3> <a href= "https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-100/pdf/STATUTE-100-Pg920.pdf"> Law Enforcement Officers Protection Act (1986) </a></h3>
				 	<p> After a shootout between two bank robbers and eight FBI agents in Miami killed two agents, Congress decided to regulate the manufacture, importation, and sale of armor piercing ammunition. The act made the manufacture and importation of armor piercing ammunition illegal and established prison time for individuals possessing armor piercing ammo. </p>

				 	<h3> <a href = "https://www.congress.gov/103/bills/hr1025/BILLS-103hr1025enr.pdf">Brady Handgun Violence prevention Act (1993) </a></h3>

					<p>
					The Brady Law imposed a five-day waiting period for the purchase of a handgun in order for local law-enforcement officials to be able to perform background checks. This was struck down by the Supreme Court in Printz v. United States in 1997. However, from 1998 to today, federally liscensed dealers are required to use a National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) to conduct background checks on anyone intending to purchase a firearm. 
					</p>
					<h4> National Instant Criminal Background Check System </h4>
					<p> The NICS was launched by the FBI in 1998 and is used by Federal Firearms Lincensees (FFLs) to instantly determine whether a prospective buyer is elligible to buy a firearm. Before allowing the sale, dealers must call in a check to the FBI to make sure that the customer is not inelligible to buy a firearm. The NCIS only provides service to 30 states. If the NCIS is unavailable, states must perform their own background checks.

					 <div class="text" style="margin-left: 50px; line-height: 1.5">
			This journal article by Franklin E. Zimring at Berkeley Law explains the intricacies of the Gun Control Act of 1968 which was a pivotal law in the nation’s history of gun legislation. The article explores why the law was passed and what effects it has had since its passing. In order to provide as much information on gun legislation as possible on my website, it is imperative to include current federal gun laws, the Gun Control Act of 1968 being one of them. This article is helpful in understanding what the Gun Control Act of 1968 was, why it was passed, and how it is affecting our gun legislation today. It also elaborates on “legal impact” and what legislation must do in order to be impactful which is helpful for understanding what laws need to be passed in the future.
