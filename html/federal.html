  						“One reason math texts are so abstruse and technical is because of all the specifications and conditions that have to be put on theorems to keep them out of crevasses. In this sense, they’re like legal documents, and often about as much fun to read.”<br/><br/>

					If you’re really serious about learning the theory and practice of digital signal processing, you should <i>not</i> use this website as your sole resource. Wherever a compromise was necessary, I’ve erred in favor of simplicity over completeness, fun and engagement over rigor. This text is a piece of pop-science and you should treat it as such.
					</p>

				  	<p>
					If you want a solid introduction to digital signal processing, I strongly suggest that you read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Digital-Signal-Processing-Edition/dp/0137027419"> Understanding Digital Signal Processing </a> by Richard J Lyons. Lyons writes with a great deal of empathy for the reader, patiently explicating concepts that other authors might deem to be “obvious”. Paolo Prandoni and Martin Vetterli periodically offer <a href="https://youtu.be/Fa-r34Ciwog">a course</a> on digital signal processing through <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/dsp">Coursera</a>. Their course is free, and the lectures are really quite lovely. Martin and Paolo have also written <a href="http://www.sp4comm.org/">Signal Processing for Communications</a>, which is freely available online.<sup>6</sup> <a href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/">Julius O. Smith III</a> has an encyclopedic catalog of DSP writings freely available on his <a href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/"> site</a>. Smith’s online text, <a href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/mdft/">The Mathematics of the Discrete Fourier Transform </a> is of particular interest. <a href="http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~dpwe/">Dan Ellis</a> posts all of his teaching materials online for free and open access. Geoff Martin’s delightful <a href="http://www.tonmeister.ca/main/textbook/index.html">online book</a> is recommended if you’re interested in a less formal, but still very thorough resource on mathematics and DSP.

						<i>Heavily</i> inspired. If you suspect that I’ve cribbed anything, you’re probably right. Any similarities between this text and their stuff can be attributed to my great admiration for these people and their work.<br/><br/>
					<b>8.</b>
						That being said, this is <i>not</i> a coding project. This project is primarily an experimental piece of educational art. Don’t let my sloppy coding reflect poorly on the underlying technology.
