				 	<p> Starting with the 2nd Amendment of the Constitution, here are all of the federal laws that currently affect gun usage in the United States. Click the links in the titles to read the actual bills themselves:</p>
				 	<h3> Second Amendment (1789) </h3>
				 	<p>A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. </p>
				 	<h3> <a href = "https://archive.org/stream/NationalFirearmsActOf1934/National_Firearms_Act_of_1934_djvu.txt"> National Firearms Act (1934) </a></h3>
				 	<p> The National Firearms Act was passed to control the types of weapons used in organized crime and gangs: automatic weapons like machine guns and easily concealed short-barrel firearms such as sawed-off shotguns, along with mufflers and silencers (called "NFA firearms or devices"). The act did not ban them, instead it forced importers, manufacturers, and dealers to register them and pay an annual tax. It also required that intended purchasers complete an application including fingerprints and a photograph, and that importers, manufacturers, and dealers keep records of all transactions. </p>
				 	<h3><a href = "https://archive.org/stream/GunControlActOf1968PubLaw9061882StatPg1213/Gun_Control_Act_of_1968_Pub_Law_90-618_82_Stat_Pg_1213_djvu.txt"> Gun Control Act (1968)</a> </h3>
				 	<p> The Gun Control Act of 1968 was passed "to provide support to Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials in their fight against crime and violence." In order to accomplish that, it: </p>
				 	<p> <ul> 
				 		<li>Mandated liscensing for all importers, dealers, and manufacturers of firearms and ammunition involved in interstate or foreign arms with a Federal Firearms License (FFL)</li>
				 		<li> Prohibited using false information to acquire a firearm. </li>
				 		<li> Set the age for purchasing a handgun at 21.</li>
				 		<li> Prohibited the selling of firearms to convicted criminals, fugitives, drug addicts or mentally incompetent individuals. </li>
				 		<li> Required registration of all firearms with the national Firearms Registration and Transfer Record. </li>
				 		<li> Prohibited the possession of firearms which have altered or removed serial numbers </li>
				 		<li> Eliminated mail order delivery of firearms to unlicensed individuals. </li>
				 	</ul></p>

				 	<h3> <a href= "https://www.congress.gov/bill/99th-congress/senate-bill/49"> Firearms Owners' Protection Act (1986) </a></h3>
				 	<p> The Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986 (FOPA) banned the sale of machine guns manufactured after the date the act was passed to civilians. The sale of these weapons was restricted to the military and law enforcement. </p>

				 	<h3> <a href = "https://www.congress.gov/103/bills/hr1025/BILLS-103hr1025enr.pdf">Brady Handgun Violence prevention Act (1993) </a></h3>

					<p>
					The Brady Law imposed a five-day waiting period for the purchase of a handgun in order for local law-enforcement officials to be able to perform background checks. This was struck down by the Supreme Court in Printz v. United States in 1997. However, from 1998 to today, federally liscensed dealers are required to use a National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) to conduct background checks on anyone intending to purchase a firearm.

				 	<h3> <a href = "https://www.congress.gov/103/bills/hr1025/BILLS-103hr1025enr.pdf">Brady Handgun Violence prevention Act (1993) </a></h3>

					<p>
					The Brady Law imposed a five-day waiting period for the purchase of a handgun in order for local law-enforcement officials to be able to perform background checks. This was struck down by the Supreme Court in Printz v. United States in 1997. However, from 1998 to today, federally liscensed dealers are required to use a National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) to conduct background checks on anyone intending to purchase a firearm. 
					</p>
					<h4> National Instant Criminal Background Check System </h4>
					<p> The NICS was launched by the FBI in 1998 and is used by Federal Firearms Lincensees (FFLs) to instantly determine whether a prospective buyer is elligible to buy a firearm. Before allowing the sale, dealers must call in a check to the FBI to make sure that the customer is not inelligible to buy a firearm. The NCIS only provides service to 30 states. If the NCIS is unavailable, states must perform their own background checks. 
					</p>
<hr></br>
					<h2> LOOPHOLES </h2>
					<h3> Background Checks </h3>
					<p> Under Federal Law, buyers of firearms must pass a background check. Most come up with no problems, but some are deemed inconclusive. The FBI then has 3 days to finish the check. However, if no results are sent within 3 days the transaction will go through without completing the check. In 2014 2.76% of gun owners went through this loophole. In 2017 it was 3.59%. This particular loophole was also how Dylann Roof, the perpetrator of the Charleston church shooting in 2015, acquired a gun, despite the fact he should have failed a background check. </p>

					<h3> Gun Shows </h3>
					<p>Guns shows are environments within federal firearm laws can be largely ignored with no consequence. The Gun Control Act of 1968 dictates that all sellers of guns have a Federal Firearm License. However, that doesn’t apply to private sellers selling from their own collection. Therefore, private sellers do not have to record their sales, nor do they have to do a background check on the buyer. At gun shows 25% to 50% of sellers are private dealers, which in turn attracts criminals to acquire guns at gun shows because of the anonymity provided. </p>

					<h3> Automatic Weapons Purchased Before 1986 </h3>
					<p> Although automatic firearms are banned due to the 1986 Firearm Owners’ Protection Act, any automatic weapons manufactured before the act was passed are considered legal. So, it is legal for Americans to own automatic weapons as long as they were made before 1986. </p>

					<h3> Modification of Semiautomatic Weapons </h3>
					<p> It is completely legal to sell kits that allow owners to convert their semiautomatic weapons to automatic weapons. Automatic weapons can fire hundreds of rounds per minute. Semiautomatic weapons can fire around 12 or so. These converters are called bump stocks. Stephen Paddock, the Las Vegas shooter, had 12 bump stocks. </p>

					 <div class="text" style="margin-left: 50px; line-height: 1.5">
			This journal article by Franklin E. Zimring at Berkeley Law explains the intricacies of the Gun Control Act of 1968 which was a pivotal law in the nation’s history of gun legislation. The article explores why the law was passed and what effects it has had since its passing. In order to provide as much information on gun legislation as possible on my website, it is imperative to include current federal gun laws, the Gun Control Act of 1968 being one of them. This article is helpful in understanding what the Gun Control Act of 1968 was, why it was passed, and how it is affecting our gun legislation today. It also elaborates on “legal impact” and what legislation must do in order to be impactful which is helpful for understanding what laws need to be passed in the future.
