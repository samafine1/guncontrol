						Franklin E. Zimring, Firearms and Federal Law: The Gun Control Act of 1968, 4 J. Legal Stud. 133 (1975)
					</div>
					 <div class="text" style="margin-left: 50px; line-height: 1.5">
			This journal article by Franklin E. Zimring at Berkeley Law explains the intricacies of the Gun Control Act of 1968 which was a pivotal law in the nation’s history of gun legislation. The article explores why the law was passed and what effects it has had since its passing. In order to provide as much information on gun legislation as possible on my website, it is imperative to include current federal gun laws, the Gun Control Act of 1968 being one of them. This article is helpful in understanding what the Gun Control Act of 1968 was, why it was passed, and how it is affecting our gun legislation today. It also elaborates on “legal impact” and what legislation must do in order to be impactful which is helpful for understanding what laws need to be passed in the future.
