						Franklin E. Zimring, Firearms and Federal Law: The Gun Control Act of 1968, 4 J. Legal Stud. 133 (1975)
					</div>
					 <div class="text" style="margin-left: 50px; line-height: 1.5">
			This journal article by Franklin E. Zimring at Berkeley Law explains the intricacies of the Gun Control Act of 1968 which was a pivotal law in the nation’s history of gun legislation. The article explores why the law was passed and what effects it has had since its passing. In order to provide as much information on gun legislation as possible on my website, it is imperative to include current federal gun laws, the Gun Control Act of 1968 being one of them. This article is helpful in understanding what the Gun Control Act of 1968 was, why it was passed, and how it is affecting our gun legislation today. It also elaborates on “legal impact” and what legislation must do in order to be impactful which is helpful for understanding what laws need to be passed in the future.

				Suzanne Levy is a writer and radio and TV producer who has written and worked for NPR, the New York Times, and BBC. In this article for KPCC, a Southern California based news organization and radio station, she created an infographic chart which compares California and federal firearms laws in many categories, from the age requirement to the requirements on permits to carry. The graphic breaks down the vast differences in law in 11 different categories. The website we are creating is specifically for students and people from California, so this source is particularly helpful in getting information about the differences between federal and California law that we can include in the website.

					This recent article by Associated Press journalist Don Thompson outlines 10 new gun control bills that have been proposed by Californian assembly people. These 10 new bills would increase restrictions on firearms in California and expand the the definitions of what is classified as an assault weapon and who can report possible dangerous individuals for firearm restraining orders. The bills are an extension of several other passed at the beginning of 2018, and were influenced by the shooting at Stoneman Douglass. The article will be used on the website to inform readers about the possibility of increased gun legislation in California and will be paired with more information about legislation that is already in place. Readers of the website will be informed about possible laws and can use that information to mobilize behind some of these bills.
